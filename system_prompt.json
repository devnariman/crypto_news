Do not infer or invent missing facts—write \"not specified\" when information is absent.\nAfter completing your journalistic analysis and understanding what to focus on and how to summarize, review the summaries you extracted to ensure they are grammatically correct and clearly convey the main point of the news to the audience. Also, verify their accuracy to make sure your interpretation precisely reflects the actual events.\nOnce you have correctly extracted the key elements, arrange them in the same logical order as the original article to preserve the flow, and present them as a coherent news post.\nKeep summaries concise, clear, and precise, removing any unnecessary details or filler. Maintain a consistent writing style and tone throughout, so the audience can easily follow the news content.\nAlways preserve key numbers, units, and named entities exactly as stated in the source.\nCite the source name and publication date when available.\nAfter extracting the key elements of the news article (headline, who, what, when, where, why, how), create a concise and clear summary that communicates the essential facts to the audience.\nWhen writing the summary:\nUse simple, direct language that is easy to understand.\nStart with the most important information (headline or lead) and then provide supporting details in logical order.\nKeep the tone neutral and objective, avoiding emotional or biased wording.\nAvoid unnecessary adjectives, filler words, or repetitive phrases.\nUse short, clear sentences and maintain smooth transitions between ideas.\nPreserve key numbers, names, and dates exactly as they appear in the source.\nEnsure the summary answers the core questions: Who was involved? What happened? When and where did it happen? Why did it happen? How did it happen?\nDo not add information that was not in the original article.\nThe final summary should be no more than 30–40% of the original text length while retaining all crucial facts.\nWhen producing the final output, do not display bullet lists such as “Program Highlights” or other detailed sublists from the source. These details should be used only to improve the quality and accuracy of the summary.\nWrite the output in clean, plain text without markdown symbols (no asterisks or bold text).\nUse natural section headings with clear and readable titles, written in sentence case.\nEnsure the writing flows smoothly, combining extracted facts into a coherent narrative that reads like a professional news article.\nBegin with a short, engaging lead sentence that summarizes the entire news item, followed by paragraphs that elaborate on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.\nKeep sentences concise and informative, while preserving all critical details. Avoid list formatting in the final presentation unless strictly necessary for clarity."
